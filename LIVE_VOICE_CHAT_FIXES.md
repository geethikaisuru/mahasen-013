# Live Voice Chat Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. `navigator.mediaDevices` is undefined error
**Problem**: The error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getUserMedia')` occurred when trying to access microphone.

**Root Cause**: The `navigator.mediaDevices` API is only available in secure contexts (HTTPS or localhost) and modern browsers.

**Solution**: 
- Added checks for `window.isSecureContext` before attempting microphone access
- Added fallback error handling for when `navigator.mediaDevices` is undefined
- Added proper error messages explaining the requirements

### 2. Audio worklet node not available
**Problem**: Audio features would fail completely if microphone initialization failed.

**Root Cause**: The service tried to use audio worklet even when audio initialization failed.

**Solution**:
- Modified `startConversation()` to gracefully handle audio initialization failures
- Allow the service to continue in text-only mode when audio is unavailable
- Added `isAudioAvailable()` method to check audio status
- Updated audio-related methods to check availability before attempting operations

### 3. Poor error handling and user feedback
**Problem**: Users had no clear indication of why voice features weren't working.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error messages explaining common issues (HTTPS requirement, browser compatibility)
- Added visual indicators in the UI when audio is unavailable
- Added warning alerts for different scenarios (insecure context, audio unavailable)
- Added `audioAvailable` and `audioError` states to the hook

## New Features Added

### Audio Availability Detection
- `GeminiLiveChatService.checkMicrophoneAvailability()` - Static method to check if microphone access is possible
- `isAudioAvailable()` - Instance method to check if audio features are currently working
- Early detection of audio issues before attempting to start conversation

### Graceful Degradation
- Service can now operate in text-only mode when audio is unavailable
- UI adapts to show appropriate warnings and disable audio-related controls
- Connection to Gemini API works even without audio capabilities

### Enhanced Error Messages
- Specific error messages for different failure scenarios:
  - Insecure context (HTTP instead of HTTPS)
  - Browser compatibility issues
  - Permission denied
  - AudioContext not supported
  - AudioWorklet not supported

### Updated UI Components
- Warning alerts for audio unavailability
- HTTPS requirement notifications
- Disabled speaker controls when audio is unavailable
- Status text updates to indicate text-only mode

## Technical Changes

### Service Layer (`gemini-live-chat.service.ts`)
- Added secure context validation
- Added proper cleanup for failed audio initialization
- Enhanced error handling with specific error types
- Added audio availability checks throughout audio-related methods
- Modified state management to support "connected" state without audio

### Hook Layer (`use-gemini-live-chat.ts`)
- Added `audioAvailable` and `audioError` state tracking
- Added `clearAudioError()` action
- Enhanced error callback to distinguish audio-related errors
- Added early audio availability checking on mount

### UI Layer (`live-voice-chat/page.tsx`)
- Added audio warning displays
- Added HTTPS requirement warnings
- Updated status text to indicate audio availability
- Disabled audio controls when audio is unavailable
- Added helpful tooltips and error messages

## Usage Notes

### Development Environment
- Use `https://localhost:3000` or similar for development
- Ensure your `.env.local` has a valid `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY`

### Production Environment
- Must be served over HTTPS
- Users need to grant microphone permissions
- Fallback to text-only mode works automatically

### Browser Compatibility
- Requires browsers that support:
  - MediaDevices API
  - AudioContext/WebAudioAPI
  - AudioWorklet
  - WebSocket
- Gracefully degrades in unsupported browsers

## Error Messages Reference

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Microphone access requires a secure context" | Running on HTTP | Use HTTPS or localhost |
| "Media devices API not available" | Browser doesn't support WebRTC | Use a modern browser |
| "AudioContext not supported" | Browser doesn't support Web Audio | Use a modern browser |
| "AudioWorklet not supported" | Browser doesn't support AudioWorklet | Use Chrome 66+ or equivalent |
| "Permission denied" | User blocked microphone access | Grant permission in browser settings |

# Live Voice Chat Fixes - AI Not Responding Issue

## Problem Analysis

The AI was not responding after you finished speaking because of several critical issues in the Live API implementation:

### Root Causes Identified:

1. **Incorrect Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Implementation**
   - Custom silence detection was interfering with Live API's built-in VAD
   - Sending empty audio data as "silence signal" was incorrect
   - Missing proper VAD configuration in session setup

2. **Missing Turn Management**
   - No proper signaling when user speech ends
   - Incorrect use of `sendRealtimeInput` without proper turn boundaries
   - Missing `audioStreamEnd` signals when audio stream pauses

3. **State Management Issues**
   - Improper state transitions between listening and speaking
   - Audio playback completion not triggering return to listening state
   - Race conditions in state changes

4. **Configuration Problems**
   - Missing `realtimeInputConfig` with automatic activity detection
   - Incorrect sensitivity settings for speech detection

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Proper VAD Configuration
```typescript
const config = {
  responseModalities: [Modality.AUDIO],
  mediaResolution: MediaResolution.MEDIA_RESOLUTION_MEDIUM,
  systemInstruction: {
    parts: [{ text: this.systemInstruction }]
  },
  // ✅ Added proper VAD configuration
  realtimeInputConfig: {
    automaticActivityDetection: {
      disabled: false, // Use automatic VAD
      startOfSpeechSensitivity: StartSensitivity.START_SENSITIVITY_LOW,
      endOfSpeechSensitivity: EndSensitivity.END_SENSITIVITY_LOW,
      prefixPaddingMs: 300,
      silenceDurationMs: 1000, // 1 second of silence before considering speech ended
    }
  }
};
```

### 2. Removed Custom VAD Logic
- ❌ Removed custom silence detection variables
- ❌ Removed `sendSilenceSignal()` method
- ❌ Removed manual voice activity tracking
- ✅ Now relies on Live API's built-in VAD

### 3. Added Proper Audio Stream Management
```typescript
// ✅ Send audio stream end when conversation stops
private sendAudioStreamEnd() {
  if (this.session && this.isRunning) {
    try {
      this.session.sendRealtimeInput({ audioStreamEnd: true });
      console.log('Audio stream end signal sent to Gemini');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error sending audio stream end:', error);
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Fixed State Transitions
```typescript
// ✅ Proper state transition when AI starts responding
if (this.state === 'listening') {
  console.log('🎤➡️🗣️ Transitioning from listening to speaking');
  this.setState('speaking');
}

// ✅ Proper return to listening after audio playback
source.onended = () => {
  console.log('🔊 Audio playback completed, transitioning back to listening');
  this.isPlayingAudio = false;
  this.currentAudioSource = null;
  this.accumulatedAudioData = new Int16Array(0);
  this.setState('listening'); // ✅ Always return to listening
};
```

### 5. Enhanced Turn Completion Handling
```typescript
// ✅ Handle turn completion properly
if (message.serverContent?.turnComplete) {
  console.log('🏁 Turn complete, AI finished speaking');
  if (this.accumulatedAudioData.length > 0 && !this.isPlayingAudio) {
    this.playAccumulatedAudio();
  } else if (this.accumulatedAudioData.length === 0) {
    // No audio to play, transition back to listening immediately
    this.setState('listening');
  }
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Normal Conversation Flow:
1. **User starts speaking** → State: `listening`
2. **Live API detects speech** → Automatic VAD handles detection
3. **User stops speaking** → Live API detects silence (1 second)
4. **AI processes and responds** → State: `speaking`
5. **Audio playback completes** → State: `listening` (ready for next input)

### Key Improvements:
- ✅ **Automatic speech end detection** via Live API VAD
- ✅ **Proper turn management** with `turnComplete` handling
- ✅ **Reliable state transitions** between listening and speaking
- ✅ **Audio stream end signals** when conversation stops
- ✅ **Enhanced logging** for debugging conversation flow

## Testing the Fixes

### What to Test:
1. **Start conversation** - Should connect and show "listening" state
2. **Speak normally** - Should detect your voice and show volume
3. **Stop speaking** - Should automatically detect end of speech after 1 second
4. **AI response** - Should transition to "speaking" and play audio
5. **Response completion** - Should return to "listening" automatically
6. **Multiple turns** - Should handle back-and-forth conversation

### Debug Logging:
The console will now show detailed logs:
- `🎤➡️🗣️ Transitioning from listening to speaking`
- `🏁 Turn complete, AI finished speaking`
- `🔊 Audio playback completed, transitioning back to listening`
- `🗣️➡️🎤 No audio to play, transitioning back to listening`

## Configuration Notes

### Environment Variables Required:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### Model Used:
- `gemini-2.0-flash-live-001` (Live API compatible model)

### Audio Settings:
- **Input**: 16kHz, 16-bit PCM, mono
- **Output**: 24kHz, 16-bit PCM, mono
- **VAD Sensitivity**: Low (adjustable)
- **Silence Duration**: 1000ms before speech end detection

## Troubleshooting

### If AI Still Doesn't Respond:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify API key is correctly set
3. Ensure microphone permissions are granted
4. Check network connectivity
5. Look for VAD detection logs in console

### Common Issues:
- **Microphone not detected**: Grant browser permissions
- **No audio output**: Check speaker/headphone settings
- **Connection errors**: Verify API key and network
- **State stuck in listening**: Check console for VAD detection logs

The fixes address the core issue of the Live API not properly detecting when you finish speaking and not transitioning correctly between conversation states. The automatic VAD should now handle speech detection reliably, and the proper state management ensures the conversation flows naturally.
