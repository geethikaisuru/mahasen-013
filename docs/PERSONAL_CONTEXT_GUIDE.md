## Privacy and Security

### Data Protection
- Personal context data is stored securely in Firebase Firestore
- Email content is analyzed but not permanently stored
- Only email metadata and patterns are retained

### Access Control
- Each user's context is isolated and private
- Firestore security rules prevent unauthorized access
- Data can be deleted at any time using the "Delete All Data" function

### What Data is Stored
- Communication style patterns and preferences
- Contact relationship classifications (email addresses only)
- Professional profile information
- Personal preference patterns
- Learning metadata and confidence scores

### What Data is NOT Stored
- Full email content or bodies
- Gmail access tokens
- Sensitive personal information beyond communication patterns
- Private email content or attachments

## API Integration

### Using Personal Context in Your App

#### Chat Integration
The chat assistant automatically uses personal context when available:

```typescript
// Chat API automatically includes personal context
const response = await fetch('/api/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    message: userMessage,
    userId: currentUserId 
  })
});
```

#### Direct API Access
Access personal context programmatically:

```typescript
import { personalContextService } from '@/services/personal-context/personal-context-service';

// Get user's personal context
const profile = await personalContextService.getPersonalContext(userId);

// Get user statistics
const stats = await personalContextService.getUserStatistics(userId);

// Start learning process
const result = await personalContextService.learnPersonalContext({
  userId,
  accessToken,
  options: {
    timeRange: 'last_3months',
    analysisDepth: 'standard',
    includePromotional: false,
    minThreadLength: 2
  }
});
```

#### React Hook
Use the provided React hook for state management:

```typescript
import { usePersonalContext } from '@/hooks/usePersonalContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const {
    profile,
    statistics,
    isLoading,
    error,
    learnPersonalContext,
    getPersonalContext
  } = usePersonalContext();

  // Component logic here
}
```

#### Global Context Provider
Use the context provider for app-wide personal context state:

```typescript
import { PersonalContextProvider, usePersonalContextGlobal } from '@/contexts/PersonalContextProvider';

// Wrap your app
function App() {
  return (
    <PersonalContextProvider defaultUserId="user-123">
      <YourAppContent />
    </PersonalContextProvider>
  );
}

// Use in components
function MyComponent() {
  const { profile, hasPersonalContext } = usePersonalContextGlobal();
  // Component logic here
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Learning Endpoints
- `POST /api/personal-context/learn` - Start learning from Gmail
- `POST /api/personal-context/test-connection` - Test Gmail connection

### Data Endpoints
- `GET /api/personal-context/profile?userId={id}` - Get personal context profile
- `PUT /api/personal-context/profile` - Update personal context profile
- `GET /api/personal-context/statistics?userId={id}` - Get user statistics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Gmail Connection Failed
- Verify your access token is valid and has read permissions
- Check that Gmail API is enabled for your project
- Ensure the token hasn't expired

#### No Personal Context Found
- Make sure you've completed the learning process
- Check that your Gmail account has sufficient email history
- Verify the time range includes relevant email activity

#### Low Confidence Scores
- Increase the analysis time range
- Switch to "comprehensive" analysis depth
- Ensure you have varied email conversations in the selected time range

#### Learning Process Stuck
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Verify your internet connection
- Try reducing the time range or analysis depth

### Getting Help
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages
- Review the Personal Context page's Overview tab for system status
- Use the "Test Connection" feature to verify Gmail integration

## Best Practices

### For Optimal Learning
1. **Sufficient Data**: Use at least 3 months of email history
2. **Varied Conversations**: Ensure your email includes different types of communications
3. **Regular Updates**: Re-run learning periodically to capture evolving patterns
4. **Quality over Quantity**: Focus on meaningful email threads rather than promotional emails

### For Privacy
1. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your learned profile
2. **Data Cleanup**: Delete personal context data when no longer needed
3. **Access Control**: Keep your Gmail tokens secure and don't share them
4. **Manual Override**: Use manual input for sensitive context information

### For Integration
1. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with basic features before advanced integration
2. **User Control**: Always provide users control over their personal context
3. **Fallback Behavior**: Ensure your app works well without personal context
4. **Performance**: Cache personal context data to avoid repeated API calls

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Learning Parameters
Modify learning behavior by adjusting options:

```typescript
const advancedOptions = {
  timeRange: 'last_6months',
  analysisDepth: 'comprehensive',
  includePromotional: false,
  minThreadLength: 3,
  // Add custom filters or processing rules
};
```
